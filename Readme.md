# THE IDEA:
### The problem we are addressing:
Students move untracked in large educational institutions like schools and colleges

### The solution we propose for this problem:
We propose to design a system where individual CCTVs placed at various locations in the school capture images, and a classifier based ML Model recognises the faces of every student in the picture, and mark their real time location on a portal which can be accessed by administrator support

### A brief of our project and how it is beneficial for the masses:
1. Automation of attendance and proxy can be avoided. The central server will receive live feed from CCTVs installed in the classrooms, take snapshots from the videos, and then analyse the faces in the snapshots to flag students who are not present in the classroom they are supposed to be in at that time according to the timetable.
2. People whose faces don't match any face in the student/employee database will be flagged as outsiders (unrecognised faces brought to the attention of authorities)
